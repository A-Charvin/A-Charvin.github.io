GEOM 101 - Assignment 2 Submission Website

Introduction :

The assignment was to complete a working website with atlest 2 pages,
Includes certain features as per requirement and validated without issues.

Project time line till completion :

Day 0 : Tools, Methodology, Planning,
That was only supposed to take a Day but in reality it got pushed way back to a few weeks prior to submission,
I can give up reasons to why it took that long but regardless a plan was made.

Some weeks before submission deadline : 
A rough drawing about how the site is going to look like was formulated.
It was decided that the site will have 4 sections on front
and another single section on the second page.

Almost a week before DDay
Disaster struck in the form of a dead laptop. But alas.. ah. had to start from scratch, order a new system work on a loaner device.
all that apart, 4+1 section plan was dropped since there was a heafty struggle with flex boxes and aliging tables and heading on the site.
decided to drop it to 3+1 with a home block, about section, and a table on the home page and a portfolio/ interactable images section on the second page.

Publishing and Validating.
Uttermost care was given and was almost pulling hairs out and sweating prufusingly while entering the site into the validators.
And to no surprise, It came out with an error. Not a bad one. Fixed that and published it on 15/10

- Hoping for the best. This is in no way a perfect website, I had to go through a few sleepless nights and lots of references and resources 
(cited as many as I could go and grab). It is now out there in the wild, for any one to see and all the hard worked and struggled till it reached it's current form code is available as well to look into, If any one of you comes across this and has some suggestions to improve this small assignement website in any way. 
Please make a commit and push the changes. It will greatly help me lean new things and to do things in a new prespective.

Thank you!
