<!-- Home page inspiration came from https://dribbble.com/ujjol07 
Tried to replicate that with a dark background and matching fonts.
For this particular state that being, Ubuntu 
(It has clear visual aid to differentiat the IiLl's and I love that)
and poppins, It is a thin yet crisp font for some style here and there. -->

<!-- About section was visualised as two part, with left showing an image
and the right section showing some text, This was way harder to get right.
Struggled with flex box and align commands for hours till this reached a
somewhat presentable form as of now. Still not sure if this will hold.
It is technically running on jenga mode.

<!-- Table block took way too much time on first attempt to properly implement, 
    due to the nature of tables styling them was ok until aligning them to the page came up
    that was a real struggle and in the end this is what it ended up as. I'm not fully happy with it, But
    it works (somehow) and as long as it works. It is fine. (Still not aligned to center like How I was aiming to)
